# A little about myself...

I'm a developer that started my career as a designer. You can occasionally catch me trying to shake off the rust by opening up Figma and pushing things around the screen.

In my free time I like to find ways to blend my interests with technology. Some of those interests are rolling polyhedrons in a weekly Dungeons & Dragons campaign, building mechanical keyboards, traveling and cooking.
